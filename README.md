# Burrows-Wheeler-algs4
My solution for programming assignment "Burrowsâ€“Wheeler" at Algorithms, Part II by Princeton University.
Honestly, not my best solution. Solution experiences some problems with timing. But I have not time to solve it ))
Due to the limits of the Princeton course explicit class deriving is prohibited. 
So my solution includes classes LSDext.java,  Quick3string.java wich are modified versions of Princeton's classes LSD.java and Quick3string.java. Also solution uses other Princeton's classes: BinaryStdIn.java, BinaryStdOut.java, Queue.java. Programming assignment itself can be found here: https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/burrows/specification.php
